### Version
Document Version: 1.0.0

It is recommended to include a `manifestPlusVersion` property in your manifest which denotes which version of Manifest+ you have implemented. We do not intend for breaking changes to this spec, but if they do happen we will increment the major version in accordance with [Semver](https://semver.org/).

```json
"manifestPlusVersion": "1.0.0"
```
